	isbn = {978-0-374-53355-7 0-374-53355-5},
	abstract = {In the international bestseller, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation-each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives-and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.},

An opt-in panel study of 1,910 Facebook users linked self-reported measures of well-being to counts of respondents' Facebook activities from server logs. Specific uses of the site were associated with improvements in well-being: Receiving targeted, composed communication from strong ties was associated with improvements in well-being while viewing friends' wide-audience broadcasts and receiving one-click feedback were not. These results suggest that people derive benefits from online communication, as long it comes from people they care about and has been tailored for them.},

What makes a meme and what distinguishes it from other forms of information, however, is still poorly understood. Our analysis of memes in the scientific literature reveals that they are governed by a surprisingly simple relationship between frequency of occurrence and the degree to which they propagate along the citation graph. We propose a simple formalization of this pattern and we validate it with data from close to 50 million publication records from the Web of Science, {PubMed} Central, and the American Physical Society. Evaluations relying on human annotators, citation network randomizations, and comparisons with several alternative approaches confirm that our formula is accurate and effective, without a dependence on linguistic or ontological knowledge and without the application of arbitrary thresholds or filters.},

	url = {https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/new-york-times-update/},
	abstract = {Yesterday, The New York Times published an article about the past two years at Facebook. There are a number of inaccuracies in the story, including: Russia Investigation: The story asserts that we knew about Russian activity as early as the spring of 2016 but were slow to investigate it at every turn. This is not true. As Mark Zuckerberg told Congress, “Leading up to Election Day in November 2016, we detected and dealt with several threats with ties to Russia … [including] a group called {APT}28 … we also saw some new behavior when {APT}28-related accounts, under the banner of {DC} Leaks, created fake personas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists. We shut these accounts down for violating our policies.” After the election, no one ever discouraged Alex Stamos from looking into Russian activity — as he himself has acknowledged on Twitter repeatedly (here and here.) (Updated on November 15, 2018 at 9:40AM {PT} to include Alex’s tweet from this morning.) Indeed as The New York Times says, “Mark and Sheryl [Sandberg] expanded Alex’s work.” Finally, we did not name Russia in our April 2017 white paper — but instead cited a {US} government report in a footnote about Russian activity — because we felt that the {US} Director of National Intelligence was best placed to determine the source. The Muslim Ban: We did decide that President Trump’s comments on the Muslim ban, while abhorrent to many people, did not break our Community Standards for the same reasons The New York Times and many other organizations covered the news: Donald Trump was a candidate running for office. To suggest that the internal debate around this particular case was different from other important free speech issues on Facebook is wrong. Commitment to Fighting Fake News: Mark and Sheryl have been deeply involved in the fight against false news and information operations on Facebook — as they have been consistently involved in all our efforts to prevent misuse of our services. Sex Trafficking Legislation: Sheryl championed this legislation because she believed it was the right thing to do, and that tech companies need to be more open to content regulation where it can prevent real world harm. In fact, the company faced considerable criticism as a result. Android: Tim Cook has consistently criticized our business model and Mark has been equally clear he disagrees. So there’s been no need to employ anyone else to do this for us. And we’ve long encouraged our employees and executives to use Android because it is the most popular operating system in the world. Lastly we wanted to address the issue of Definers, who we ended our contract with last night. The New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook’s behalf – or to spread misinformation. Our relationship with Definers was well known by the media – not least because they have on several occasions sent out invitations to hundreds of journalists about important press calls on our behalf. Definers did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of “Freedom from Facebook,” an anti-Facebook organization. The intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company. To suggest that this was an anti-Semitic attack is reprehensible and untrue. We’ve acknowledged publicly on many occasions – including before Congress – that we were too slow to spot Russian interference on Facebook, as well as other misuse. But in the two years since the 2016 Presidential election, we’ve invested heavily in more people and better technology to improve safety and security on our services. While we still have a long way to go, we’re proud of the progress we have made in fighting misinformation, removing bad content and preventing foreign actors from manipulating our platform.},

Should we take climate experts at their word when they warn us about the perils of global warming? Why should we trust science when our own politicians don't? In this landmark book, Naomi Oreskes offers a bold and compelling defense of science, revealing why the social character of scientific knowledge is its greatest strength--and the greatest reason we can trust it.  Tracing the history and philosophy of science from the late nineteenth century to today, Oreskes explains that, contrary to popular belief, there is no single scientific method. Rather, the trustworthiness of scientific claims derives from the social process by which they are rigorously vetted. This process is not perfect -- nothing ever is when humans are involved--but she draws vital lessons from cases where scientists got it wrong. Oreskes shows how consensus is a crucial indicator of when a scientific matter has been settled, and when the knowledge produced is likely to be trustworthy."--},

	abstract = {Anecdotal reports indicated that some on-line users were becoming addicted to the Internet in much the same way that others became addicted to drugs or alcohol, which resulted in academic, social, and occupational impairment. However, research among sociologists, psychologists, or psychiatrists has not formally identified addictive use of the Internet as a problematic behavior. This study investigated the existence of Internet addiction and the extent of problems caused by such potential misuse. Of all the diagnoses referenced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition ({DSM}-{IV}; American Psychiatric Association, 1995), Pathological Gambling was viewed as most akin to the pathological nature of Internet use. By using Pathological Gambling as a model, addictive Internet use can be defined as an impulse-control disorder that does not involve an intoxicant. Therefore, this study developed a brief eight-item questionnaire referred to as a Diagnostic Questionnaire ({DQ}), which modified criteria for pathological gambling to provide a screening instrument for classification of participants. On the basis of this criteria, case studies of 396 dependent Internet users (Dependents) and 100 nondependent Internet users (Nondependents) were classified. Qualitative analyses suggest significant behavioral and functional usage differences between the two groups such as the types of applications utilized, the degree of difficulty controlling weekly usage, and the severity of problems noted. Clinical and social implications of pathological Internet use and future directions for research are discussed.},

Scholars primarily use self-report measures of the quantity or duration of media use as proxies for more objective measures, but the validity of these self-reports remains unclear. Advancements in data collection techniques have produced a collection of studies indexing both self-reported and log-based measures. To assess the alignment between these measures, we conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis of this research. Based on 106 effect sizes, we found that self-reported media use correlates only moderately with logged measurements, that self-reports were rarely an accurate reflection of logged media use and that measures of problematic media use show an even weaker association with usage logs. These findings raise concerns about the validity of findings relying solely on self-reported measures of media use.},

	abstract = {Currently about 2.71 billion humans use a smartphone worldwide. Although smartphone technology has brought many advances, a growing number of scientists discuss potential detrimental effects due to excessive smartphone use. Of importance, the likely culprit to understand over-usage is not the smartphone itself, but the excessive use of applications installed on smartphones. As the current business model of many app-developers foresees an exchange of personal data for allowance to use an app, it is not surprising that many design elements can be found in social media apps and Freemium games prolonging app usage. It is the aim of the present work to analyze several prominent smartphone apps to carve out such elements. As a result of the analysis, a total of six different mechanisms are highlighted to illustrate the prevailing business model in smartphone app development. First, these app-elements are described and second linked to classic psychological/economic theories such as the mere-exposure effect, endowment effect, and Zeigarnik effect, but also to psychological mechanisms triggering social comparison. It is concluded that many of the here presented app-elements on smartphones are able to prolong usage time, but it is very hard to understand such an effect on the level of a single element. A systematic analysis would require insights into app data usually only being available for the app-designers, but not for independent scientists. Nevertheless, the present work supports the notion that it is time to critically reflect on the prevailing business model of \&lsquo;user data in exchange for app-use allowance\&rsquo;. Instead of using a service in exchange for data, it ultimately might be better to ban or regulate certain design elements in apps to come up with less addictive products. Instead, users could pay a reasonable fee for an app service.},

	abstract = {Background Social media ({SM}) use is increasing among U.S. young adults, and its association with mental well-being remains unclear. This study assessed the association between {SM} use and depression in a nationally representative sample of young adults. Methods We surveyed 1,787 adults ages 19 to 32 about {SM} use and depression. Participants were recruited via random digit dialing and address-based sampling. {SM} use was assessed by self-reported total time per day spent on {SM}, visits per week, and a global frequency score based on the Pew Internet Research Questionnaire. Depression was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ({PROMIS}) Depression Scale Short Form. Chi-squared tests and ordered logistic regressions were performed with sample weights. Results The weighted sample was 50.3\% female and 57.5\% White. Compared to those in the lowest quartile of total time per day spent on {SM}, participants in the highest quartile had significantly increased odds of depression ({AOR} = 1.66, 95\% {CI} = 1.14–2.42) after controlling for all covariates. Compared with those in the lowest quartile, individuals in the highest quartile of {SM} site visits per week and those with a higher global frequency score had significantly increased odds of depression ({AOR} = 2.74, 95\% {CI} = 1.86–4.04; {AOR} = 3.05, 95\% {CI} = 2.03–4.59, respectively). All associations between independent variables and depression had strong, linear, dose–response trends. Results were robust to all sensitivity analyses. Conclusions {SM} use was significantly associated with increased depression. Given the proliferation of {SM}, identifying the mechanisms and direction of this association is critical for informing interventions that address {SM} use and depression.},

We addressed this issue using experience-sampling, the most reliable method for measuring in-vivo behavior and psychological experience. We text-messaged people five times per day for two-weeks to examine how Facebook use influences the two components of subjective well-being: how people feel moment-to-moment and how satisfied they are with their lives. Our results indicate that Facebook use predicts negative shifts on both of these variables over time. The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two-weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time. Interacting with other people “directly” did not predict these negative outcomes. They were also not moderated by the size of people's Facebook networks, their perceived supportiveness, motivation for using Facebook, gender, loneliness, self-esteem, or depression. On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection. Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.},

	abstract = {Social Networking Sites ({SNSs}) are virtual communities where users can create individual public profiles, interact with real-life friends, and meet other people based on shared interests. They are seen as a ‘global consumer phenomenon’ with an exponential rise in usage within the last few years. Anecdotal case study evidence suggests that ‘addiction’ to social networks on the Internet may be a potential mental health problem for some users. However, the contemporary scientific literature addressing the addictive qualities of social networks on the Internet is scarce. Therefore, this literature review is intended to provide empirical and conceptual insight into the emerging phenomenon of addiction to {SNSs} by: (1) outlining {SNS} usage patterns, (2) examining motivations for {SNS} usage, (3) examining personalities of {SNS} users, (4) examining negative consequences of {SNS} usage, (5) exploring potential {SNS} addiction, and (6) exploring {SNS} addiction specificity and comorbidity. The findings indicate that {SNSs} are predominantly used for social purposes, mostly related to the maintenance of established offline networks. Moreover, extraverts appear to use social networking sites for social enhancement, whereas introverts use it for social compensation, each of which appears to be related to greater usage, as does low conscientiousness and high narcissism. Negative correlates of {SNS} usage include the decrease in real life social community participation and academic achievement, as well as relationship problems, each of which may be indicative of potential addiction.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, Internet usage has grown tremendously on a global scale. The increasing popularity and frequency of Internet use has led to an increasing number of reports highlighting the potential negative consequences of overuse. Over the last decade, research into Internet addiction has proliferated. This paper reviews the existing 68 epidemiological studies of Internet addiction that (i) contain quantitative empirical data, (ii) have been published after 2000, (iii) include an analysis relating to Internet addiction, (iv) include a minimum of 1000 participants, and (v) provide a full-text article published in English using the database Web of Science. Assessment tools and conceptualisations, prevalence, and associated factors in adolescents and adults are scrutinised. The results reveal the following. First, no gold standard of Internet addiction classification exists as 21 different assessment instruments have been identified. They adopt official criteria for substance use disorders or pathological gambling, no or few criteria relevant for an addiction diagnosis, time spent online, or resulting problems. Second, reported prevalence rates differ as a consequence of different assessment tools and cut-offs, ranging from 0.8\% in Italy to 26.7\% in Hong Kong. Third, Internet addiction is associated with a number of sociodemographic, Internet use, and psychosocial factors, as well as comorbid symptoms and disorder in adolescents and adults. The results indicate that a number of core symptoms (i.e., compulsive use, negative outcomes and salience) appear relevant for diagnosis, which assimilates Internet addiction and other addictive disorders and also differentiates them, implying a conceptualisation as syndrome with similar etiology and components, but different expressions of addictions. Limitations include the exclusion of studies with smaller sample sizes and studies focusing on specific online behaviours. Conclusively, there is a need for nosological precision so that ultimately those in need can be helped by translating the scientific evidence established in the context of Internet addiction into actual clinical practice.},

The purpose of this study was to explore 5 popular uses of the smartphone – messaging, browsing the Internet, posting social content, reading social content, and playing games – how they relate to anxiety and depression scores, and how they vary depending on the country of the participants: Spain, the United States, and Colombia. In all three countries the ranking of most popular uses was the same: (1) Messaging, (2) Reading social content, and (3) Browsing the Internet. In the {USA}, game playing contributed to anxiety scores whereas reading social content was a protective factor; regarding depression scores, text messaging was a contributing factor. In Spain, browsing the Internet contributed to anxiety scores; regarding depression scores, messaging was a contributing factor and posting social content was a protective factor. In Colombia, no specific use influenced anxiety scores; regarding depression scores, only game playing was a protective factor. Our results showed that in all the countries, problematic smartphone use contributed to anxiety scores.},

This paper argues that all addictions consist of a number of distinct common components (salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict and relapse). The paper argues that addictions are a part of a biopsychosocial process and evidence is growing that excessive behaviours of all types do seem to have many commonalities. It is argued that an eclectic approach to the studying of addictive behaviour appears to be the most pragmatic way forward in the field. Such commonalities may have implications not only for treatment of such behaviours but also for how the general public perceive such behaviours.},

However, some psychologists have argued that use of this technology is addictive, even though little research utilises objective smartphone usage records to verify this claim. We conducted an exploratory study to identify whether behavioural differences exist between those who self-identify as addicted smartphone users and those who do not. We gathered retrospective smartphone usage data from 131 Android users and asked them about their past use to compare their perception of their usage against their actual usage. We could not identify any reliable differences between the smartphone activity of those self-identified as addicted smartphone users and other users. Furthermore, smartphone scales are generally good at identifying who believes themselves to be addicted, although they do not reflect objective smartphone use. This study questions the use of self-report measures to diagnosis behavioural addictions without relevant psychopathological constructs and emphasises the need for more rigorous study to conceptualise smartphone addiction.},

In addressing this issue, we have to ask to what extent technological and social networking addictions are of the same nature as substance addictions, and whether the consequences they lead to, if any, are severe enough to merit clinical attention. We can summarize our position on the topic by saying that {SNSs} are primarily used to increase social capital and that there is not currently enough empirical evidence on {SNSs}’ addiction potential to claim that {SNS} addition exists. Although {SNSs} can provoke certain negative consequences in a subset of their users or provide a platform for the expression of preexisting conditions, this is not sufficient support for their standalone addictive power. It is necessary to distinguish between true addictive disorders, the kind that fall under the category of substance addictions, and the negative side-effects of engaging with certain appealing activities like {SNSs} so that we do not undermine the severity of psychiatric disorders and the experience of the individuals suffering from them. We propose that psychoeducation, viewing {SNS} use in context to understand their gratifications and compensatory functions and revisiting the terminology on the subject are sufficient to address the problems that emerge from {SNS} usage.},

There has been increasing interest in the potential impact of online social networking on wellbeing, with a broadening body of new research into factors associated with both positive and negative mental health outcomes such as depression. This systematic review of empirical studies (n = 30) adds to existing research in this field by examining current quantitative studies focused on the relationship between online social networking and symptoms of depression. The academic databases {PsycINFO}, Web of Science, {CINAHL}, {MEDLINE}, and {EMBASE} were searched systematically using terms related to online social networking and depression. Reporting quality was critically appraised and the findings discussed with reference to their wider implications. The findings suggest that the relationship between online social networking and symptoms of depression may be complex and associated with multiple psychological, social, behavioral, and individual factors. Furthermore, the impact of online social networking on wellbeing may be both positive and negative, highlighting the need for future research to determine the impact of candidate mediators and moderators underlying these heterogeneous outcomes across evolving networks.},

By comparing the well-studied actions of another industry (Big Tobacco) to the current actions of Big Tech we see similar strategies employed by both industries. These strategies enable either industry to sway and influence academic and public discourse. We examine the funding of academic research as a tool used by Big Tech to put forward a socially responsible public image, influence events hosted by and decisions made by funded universities, influence the research questions and plans of individual scientists, and discover receptive academics who can be leveraged. We demonstrate how Big Tech can affect academia from the institutional level down to individual researchers. Thus, we believe that it is vital, particularly for universities and other institutions of higher learning, to discuss the appropriateness and the tradeoffs of accepting funding from Big Tech, and what limitations or conditions should be put in place.},

One hundred and fifty-seven new mothers reported on their media use and various well-being variables. On average, mothers were 27 years old ({SD} = 5.15) and infants were 7.90 months old ({SD} = 5.21). All mothers had access to the Internet in their home. New mothers spent approximately 3 hours on the computer each day, with most of this time spent on the Internet. Findings suggested that frequency of blogging predicted feelings of connection to extended family and friends which then predicted perceptions of social support. This in turn predicted maternal well-being, as measured by marital satisfaction, couple conflict, parenting stress, and depression. In sum, blogging may improve new mothers’ well-being, as they feel more connected to the world outside their home through the Internet.},

To evaluate the association between social networking site ({SNS}) use and depression in older adolescents using an experience sample method ({ESM}) approach.
Methods
Older adolescent university students completed an online survey containing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression screen ({PHQ}) and a weeklong {ESM} data collection period to assess {SNS} use.
Results
Participants (N = 190) included in the study were 58\% female and 91\% Caucasian. The mean age was 18.9 years (standard deviation = .8). Most used {SNSs} for either {\textless}30 minutes (n = 100, 53\%) or between 30 minutes and 2 hours (n = 74, 39\%); a minority of participants reported daily use of {SNS} {\textgreater}2 hours (n = 16, 8\%). The mean {PHQ} score was 5.4 (standard deviation = 4.2). No associations were seen between {SNS} use and either any depression (p = .519) or moderate to severe depression (p = .470).
Conclusions
We did not find evidence supporting a relationship between {SNS} use and clinical depression. Counseling patients or parents regarding the risk of “Facebook Depression” may be premature.},

We analyze the role of fear of missing out ({FOMO}) and intensity of {SNS} use for explaining the link between psychopathological symptoms and negative consequences of {SNS} use via mobile devices. In an online survey, 1468 Spanish-speaking Latin-American social media users between 16 and 18 years old completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ({HADS}), the Social Networking Intensity scale ({SNI}), the {FOMO} scale ({FOMOs}), and a questionnaire on negative consequences of using {SNS} via mobile device ({CERM}). Using structural equation modeling, it was found that both {FOMO} and {SNI} mediate the link between psychopathology and {CERM}, but by different mechanisms. Additionally, for girls, feeling depressed seems to trigger higher {SNS} involvement. For boys, anxiety triggers higher {SNS} involvement.},

However, few studies have investigated the possible mediating factors between {FoMO} and emotional symptoms. In this study, we studied the relationship between {FoMO} and emotional symptoms in a sample of 472 Italian adolescents aged 11–19. In particular, the study investigated the possible mediating role of perceived stress associated with experiences of neglect and negative reactions by other social media users, and social media addiction. Self-report measures were used. Results show that {FoMO} directly and indirectly predicts emotional symptoms. Additionally, {FoMO} is associated with increased sensitivity to stress associated with experiences of neglect and negative reactions by online peers, and social media addiction. Sensitivity to stress associated with neglect (but not to negative reactions) by online peers is found to mediate the relationship between {FoMO} and social media addiction, which, in turn, mediates the relationship with emotional symptoms. In general, the study shows that {FoMO} is a factor in experiencing higher sensitivity to stress associated with neglect by online peers, which in turn my act as a trigger for social media addiction, and ultimately showing a negative impact on emotional well-being of adolescents.

Participants completed a survey assessing {SNS} addiction, Facebook addiction, demography, Big Five personality traits, perceived stress, and general subjective well-being. {BSMAS} had acceptable fit with the data and demonstrated good reliability. Results showed that the scores of {BSMAS} were strongly associated with those of {BFAS} and that the relationship between the two measures was stronger in the group of Facebook-only users than in the group of multisite-social networkers. Moreover, {SNS} addiction was positively associated with perceived stress and negatively associated with subjective well-being after controlling for Facebook addiction and other study variables.

There is a growing body of research that has examined the impact of attachment styles and its influence on internet addiction (more generally) and social media addiction (more specifically). Consequently, the present study systematically reviewed the evidence concerning internet/social media addiction and attachment style. A total of 32 papers published between 2000 and 2018 met the inclusion criteria following searches in the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, {PubMed}, {ProQuest}, and Google Scholar. Findings demonstrated a significant positive association between insecure attachment (anxious and avoidant) and a more intensive and dysfunctional use of the internet and social media. Findings demonstrate that those with insecure attachment appear to use the social media sites as a way of replacing and compensating affection that is missing from those around the individual (e.g., family and peers). The findings suggest that the gratification model provides a useful framework to understand the effects of parental attachment on social media addiction. Limitations and future research are also discussed.},

In an attempt to integrate the theories of attachment and identity formation, the present study investigated the extent to which identity styles and attachment orientations account for three types of online addiction (i.e., internet addiction, online gaming addiction, and social media addiction). The sample comprised 712 Italian students (381 males and 331 females) recruited from schools and universities who completed an offline self-report questionnaire. The findings showed that addictions to the internet, online gaming, and social media were interrelated and were predicted by common underlying risk and protective factors. Among identity styles, ‘informational’ and ‘diffuse-avoidant’ styles were risk factors, whereas ‘normative’ style was a protective factor. Among attachment dimensions, the ‘secure’ attachment orientation negatively predicted the three online addictions, and a different pattern of causal relationships were observed between the styles underlying ‘anxious’ and ‘avoidant’ attachment orientations. Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that identity styles explained between 21.2 and 30\% of the variance in online addictions, whereas attachment styles incrementally explained between 9.2 and 14\% of the variance in the scores on the three addiction scales. These findings highlight the important role played by identity formation in the development of online addictions.},

	abstract = {Research into frequent, excessive, and compulsive social network activity has increased the last years, in which terms such as "social network site addiction" and "Facebook addiction" have been used interchangeably. The aim of this review is to offer more knowledge and better understanding of social network site addiction ({SNS}-addiction) among researchers as well as clinicians by presenting a narrative overview of the research field in terms of definition, measurement, antecedents, consequences, and treatment as well as recommendations for future research efforts. Seven different measures of {SNS}-addiction have been developed, although they have to a very little extent been validated against each other. The small number of studies conducted so far on this topic suggests that {SNS}-addiction is associated with health-related, academic, and interpersonal problems/issues. However such studies have relied on a simple cross-sectional study design. It is therefore hard to draw any conclusions about potential causality and long-term effects at this point, beyond hypothetical speculations. Empirical studies suggest that {SNS}-addiction is caused by dispositional factors (e.g., personality, needs, self-esteem), although relevant explanatory socio-cultural and behavioral reinforcement factors remain to be empirically explored. No well-documented treatment for {SNS}-addiction exists, but knowledge gained from Internet addiction treatment approaches might be transferable to {SNS}-addiction. Overall, the research on this topic is in its infancy, and as such the {SNS}-addiction construct needs further conceptual and empirical exploration. There is a great demand for studies using careful longitudinal designs and studies which include objective measures of both behavior and health based on broad representative samples.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Recent research suggests that use of social networking sites can be addictive for some individuals. Due to the link between motivations for media use and the development of addiction, this systematic review examines Facebook-related uses and gratifications research and Facebook addiction research. Method: Searches of three large academic databases revealed 24 studies examining the uses and gratifications of Facebook, and nine studies of Facebook addiction. Results: Comparison of uses and gratifications research reveals that the most popular mo- tives for Facebook use are relationship maintenance, passing time, entertainment, and companionship. These motivations may be related to Facebook addiction through use that is habitual, excessive, or motivated by a desire for mood alteration. Examination of Facebook addiction research indicates that Facebook use can become habitual or excessive, and some addicts use the site to escape from negative moods. However, examination of Facebook addic- tion measures highlights inconsistency in the field. Discussion: There is some evidence to support the argument that uses and gratifications of Facebook are linked with Facebook addiction. Furthermore, it appears as if the social skill model of addiction may explain Facebook addiction, but inconsistency in the measurement of this condition limits the ability to provide conclusive arguments. Conclusions: This paper recommends that further research be performed to establish the links between uses and gratifications and Facebook addiction. Furthermore, in order to enhance the construct validity of Facebook addiction, researchers should take a more systematic approach to assessment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Problematic Internet addiction or excessive Internet use is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled preoccupations, urges, or behaviors regarding computer use and Internet access that lead to impairment or distress. Currently, there is no recognition of internet addiction within the spectrum of addictive disorders and, therefore, no corresponding diagnosis. It has, however, been proposed for inclusion in the next version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder ({DSM}).
{OBJECTIVE}: To review the literature on Internet addiction over the topics of diagnosis, phenomenology, epidemiology, and treatment.
{METHODS}: Review of published literature between 2000-2009 in Medline and {PubMed} using the term "internet addiction.
{RESULTS}: Surveys in the United States and Europe have indicated prevalence rate between 1.5\% and 8.2\%, although the diagnostic criteria and assessment questionnaires used for diagnosis vary between countries. Cross-sectional studies on samples of patients report high comorbidity of Internet addiction with psychiatric disorders, especially affective disorders (including depression), anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}). Several factors are predictive of problematic Internet use, including personality traits, parenting and familial factors, alcohol use, and social anxiety.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {SCIENTIFIC} {SIGNIFICANCE}: Although Internet-addicted individuals have difficulty suppressing their excessive online behaviors in real life, little is known about the patho-physiological and cognitive mechanisms responsible for Internet addiction. Due to the lack of methodologically adequate research, it is currently impossible to recommend any evidence-based treatment of Internet addiction.},

We argue that the concept of “social network site” is not more specific than “Facebook,” so “Facebook addiction” rather than “social network addiction” is defensible. We acknowledge that more research in this area is needed and point specifically to new and important directions for future research that can shed light on the mechanism of addiction to social network sites.},

	abstract = {Cyberpsychology is a recently emergent field that examines the impact of technology upon human cognition and behavior. Given its infancy, authors have rapidly created new measures to gauge their constructs of interest. Unfortunately, few of these authors have had the opportunity to test their scales' psychometric properties and validity. This is concerning, as many theoretical assumptions may be founded upon scales with inadequate attributes. If this were found to be true, then previous findings in cyberpsychology studies would need to be retested, and future research would need to shift its focus to creating psychometrically sound and valid measures. To provide inferences on this concern, the current study examines the article reporting, scale creation, and scale reliabilities of every article published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking from its inception to July 2014. The final data set encompassed the coding of 1,478 individual articles, including 921 scales, and spanning 17 years. The results demonstrate that the simple survey methodology has become more popular over time. Authors are gradually applying empirically tested scales. However, self-created measures are still the most popular, leading to concerns about the measures' validity. Also, the use of multi-item measures has increased over time, but many articles still fail to report adequate information to assess the reliability of the applied scales. Lastly, the average scale reliability is 0.81, which barely meets standard cutoffs. Overall, these results are not overly concerning, but suggestions are given on methods to improve the reporting of measures, the creation of scales, and the state of cyberpsychology.},

	abstract = {Widespread concerns about new technologies—whether they be novels, radios, or smartphones—are repeatedly found throughout history. Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology’s positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies.},

Results were mixed across types of technology and mental health outcomes: Technology engagement had become less strongly associated with depression in the past decade, but social-media use had become more strongly associated with emotional problems. We detected no changes in five other associations or differential associations by sex. There is therefore little evidence for increases in the associations between adolescents’ technology engagement and mental health. Information about new digital media has been collected for a relatively short time; drawing firm conclusions about changes in their associations with mental health may be premature.

In this study, which encompassed three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom ( N = 17,247 after data exclusions) and included time-use-diary measures of digital-screen engagement, we used both exploratory and confirmatory study designs to introduce methodological and analytical improvements to a growing psychological research area.

Here we address these methodological challenges by applying specification curve analysis ({SCA}) across three large-scale social datasets (total n = 355,358) to rigorously examine correlational evidence for the effects of digital technology on adolescents. The association we find between digital technology use and adolescent well-being is negative but small, explaining at most 0.4\% of the variation in well-being.

	abstract = {In the past decade, research has accumulated suggesting that excessive Internet use can lead to the development of a behavioral addiction. Internet addiction has been considered as a serious threat to mental health and the excessive use of the Internet has been linked to a variety of negative psychosocial consequences. The aim of this review is to identify all empirical studies to date that used neuroimaging techniques to shed light upon the emerging mental health problem of Internet and gaming addiction from a neuroscientific perspective. Neuroimaging studies offer an advantage over traditional survey and behavioral research because with this method, it is possible to distinguish particular brain areas that are involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. A systematic literature search was conducted, identifying 18 studies. These studies provide compelling evidence for the similarities between different types of addictions, notably substance-related addictions and Internet and gaming addiction, on a variety of levels. On the molecular level, Internet addiction is characterized by an overall reward deficiency that entails decreased dopaminergic activity. On the level of neural circuitry, Internet and gaming addiction led to neuroadaptation and structural changes that occur as a consequence of prolonged increased activity in brain areas associated with addiction. On a behavioral level, Internet and gaming addicts appear to be constricted with regards to their cognitive functioning in various domains. The paper shows that understanding the neuronal correlates associated with the development of Internet and gaming addiction will promote future research and will pave the way for the development of addiction treatment approaches.},

Given the recent expansion and the expected increase in internet availability and usage in the coming years, it is important that healthcare professionals be informed about this behavior and its associated problems. Recently, psychological and psychiatric literature has described individuals that exhibit problematic internet use who often suffer from other psychiatric disorders. In the face of this comorbidity, it is essential to evaluate whether these individuals represent a distinct class of disorder, or a manifestation/coping mechanism related to other underlying diagnosis. In either event, problematic internet use negatively impacts social and emotional functioning. Based on the current limited empirical evidence, problematic internet use may best be classified as an impulse control disorder. It is therefore imperative that problematic internet use be appropriately identified among symptomatic individuals. For these reasons, we propose specific diagnostic criteria that will allow for consistent identification and assist in further study of this behavior.

In addition, the study examined the unique contributions of technology uses after factoring out demographics, anxiety and attitudes. Teens, young adults and adults (N = 1143) completed an anonymous, online questionnaire that assessed these variables. Each disorder had a unique set of predictors with 17 of the 22 signiﬁcant predictors being Facebook general use, impression management and friendship. More Facebook friends predicted more clinical symptoms of bipolar-mania, narcissism and histrionic personality disorder but fewer symptoms of dysthymia and schizoid personality disorder. Technology-related attitudes and anxieties signiﬁcantly predicted clinical symptoms of the disorders. After factoring out attitudes and anxiety, Facebook and selected technology uses predicted clinical symptoms with Facebook use, impression management and friendship being the best predictors. The results showed both positive and negative aspects of technology including social media as well as apparently detrimental effects of a preference for multitasking.},

	abstract = {Electronic communication is emotionally gratifying, but how do such technological distractions impact academic learning? The current study observed 263 middle school, high school and university students studying for 15min in their homes. Observers noted technologies present and computer windows open in the learning environment prior to studying plus a minute-by-minute assessment of on-task behavior, off-task technology use and open computer windows during studying. A questionnaire assessed study strategies, task-switching preference, technology attitudes, media usage, monthly texting and phone calling, social networking use and grade point average ({GPA}). Participants averaged less than six minutes on task prior to switching most often due to technological distractions including social media, texting and preference for task-switching. Having a positive attitude toward technology did not affect being on-task during studying. However, those who preferred to task-switch had more distracting technologies available and were more likely to be off-task than others. Also, those who accessed Facebook had lower {GPAs} than those who avoided it. Finally, students with relatively high use of study strategies were more likely to stay on-task than other students. The educational implications include allowing students short ''technology breaks'' to reduce distractions and teaching students metacognitive strategies regarding when interruptions negatively impact learning.},

We exposed colonies of the bumble bee \textit{Bombus terrestris} in the laboratory to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, then allowed them to develop naturally under field conditions. Treated colonies had a significantly reduced growth rate and suffered an 85\% reduction in production of new queens compared with control colonies.

	title = {How Big Tech funds the debate on {AI} ethics},
	url = {https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/technology/2019/06/how-big-tech-funds-debate-ai-ethics},
	abstract = {Most people are unaware of the extent to which algorithms already make life-changing decisions on their behalf. Software can diagnose illnesses, shortlist you for a job interview or assess whether you should be granted parole. As machine learning and artificial intelligence become more sophisticated, automated decision-making will become ever more influential, and the rules that underpin these decisions may one day have as much effect on daily life as the laws of nation states. But while elected governments draw up legislation in public, the technology industry is spending millions of pounds quietly attempting to shape the ethical debate about the decisions machines make. Spotlight and {NS} Tech have spent the past two months investigating the role that the industry plays in supporting British research into {AI} ethics. Data obtained under freedom of information laws reveals that Google has spent millions of pounds funding research at British universities over the last five years. Oxford University alone has received at least £17m from Google. The search giant, whose parent company was worth more than \$750bn at the time of going to print, has been fined €8.24bn over the last two years by the European Commission for its business practices. The French data protection authority fined the company a further €50m in January, and in the {UK} the Information Commissioner’s Office is currently investigating claims that the company has breached {EU} data laws. While much of the funding provided to Oxford goes towards technical research, Google and {DeepMind} – a British {AI} company wholly owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet – have also supported work at the Oxford Internet Institute ({OII}) exploring the ethics of {AI}, the civic responsibilities of tech firms and research into the auditing and transparency of automated decision-making ({ADM}). A number of academics at the {OII}, most notably Professor Luciano Floridi, Associate Professor Sandra Wachter and Dr Brent Mittelstadt, are prolific public commentators on ethical {AI} and {ADM}. Floridi is an advisor to the Information Commissioner’s Office, a board member for the {UK} government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation and a representative of the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group ({HLEG}) on {AI}. He also served on Google’s short-lived {AI} ethics board earlier this year. In January 2017, the academic journal International Data Privacy Law published an article written by Floridi, Wachter and Mittelstadt which argued that European data law does not give {EU} citizens the right to an explanation of decisions made about them by machines. Other experts expressed concern at what this might mean when software made decisions that were contentious. According to a page on the {OII}’s website, the same researchers then received a grant from Google covering work on the “underlying ethical and legal principles, as well as latent policies shaping the auditing [of automated decision-making] debate”. An {OII} spokesperson said the funding enabled the delivery of an internal workshop at the company. Later that year, {DeepMind} also committed to funding a series of work at the {OII} on a similar subject. A page on {DeepMind}’s website states that the funding would support a “research project on explainable and accountable algorithms and automated decision-making in Europe”. The project started in January last year and is led by Wachter, but also supports some of Mittelstadt’s work. When Spotlight asked the {OII} for evidence of papers that acknowledged funding from either Google or {DeepMind}, a spokesperson presented four articles, each of which were written or published in or after April this year. However, two papers identified by Spotlight, which were authored by Wachter and Mittelstadt, published since January 2018 and address approaches to algorithmic accountability, do not acknowledge that funding had been received from {DeepMind}. Other academics consulted for this feature said it would be normal practice to disclose any corporate funding in the realm of a paper’s topic, and if necessary to disclaim it for the sake of transparency. An {OII} spokesperson said that only a small proportion of its funding comes from business, that it is committed “to the highest standards of academic independence” and that all projects are carried out “in line with Oxford’s culture of academic freedom”, meaning “external funding does not compromise the value or integrity of the research output”. The institute also noted that Wachter and Mittelstadt have recently written papers which acknowledge {DeepMind}’s funding, are critical of the industry and call for more stringent regulation. “In the interests of transparency,” the spokesperson said, “we publish the details of all our corporate supporters on our website and the University of Oxford publishes a consolidated breakdown of its annual income and expenditure.” However, unlike many other organisations contacted for this piece, the {OII} refused to reveal how much the individual grants it had received from Google were worth. Another spokesperson for the university said that “the publication of research results, for example in journal articles or conference proceedings, will always acknowledge the source of any funding that has supported the work”. {DeepMind} said it was passionate about supporting the research community and proud to have supported Oxford through several “unrestricted donations”. Google has been funding research into ethics of technology for more than a decade. In 2017, the Campaign for Accountability ({CfA}) claimed to have identified 329 research papers published from 2005 onwards about “public policy matters of interest to Google that were in some way funded by the company”. The company has also partnered with a number of European organisations to launch policy research units, including Readie - a joint initiative with the innovation agency, Nesta - in London. “Google uses its immense wealth and power to attempt to influence policymakers at every level,” said Daniel Stevens, a campaigner and executive director of {CfA}, at the time. Addressing the research identified by his organisation as having been funded by the company, he said: “At a minimum, regulators should be aware that the allegedly independent legal and academic work on which they rely has been brought to them by Google.” However, it later emerged that {CfA} had in turn received funding from Oracle, which had been fighting Google in court. A recent call for papers on corporate funding published by the University of Amsterdam observed that the incident “perfectly captures the complexity of the situation this [industry funding] creates around science”. A Google spokesperson said that “academic institutions must properly disclose our funding” and that grants are only offered “for discrete pieces of research, not to shape academics’ subsequent scholarship. The researchers and institutions to whom we award research grants will often publish research with which we disagree.” The company is not alone in funding this sort of research. Facebook announced in January that it was set to donate \$7.5m to the Technical University of Munich, to fund the launch of a new {AI} ethics research centre. Two months later, Amazon announced it would partner with the {US} National Science Foundation ({NSF}) “to commit up to \$10m each in research grants over the next three years focused on fairness in {AI}”. Academics are divided over the ethics of such funding. While some say businesses play an important role in supporting research, others question whether this work can ever be entirely independent. “It creates a level of dependency, especially in an age where there’s such pressure to get external funding,” says Lina Dencik, the co-director of the Data Justice Lab at Cardiff University and a member of the Funding Matters initiative. “In that context, it’s even more pressing that there are more discussions around who universities should and shouldn’t accept money from.” Oxford confirmed that it had not rejected any offers of funding from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple or Microsoft over the last five years. “A university abdicates its central role when it accepts funding from a firm to study the moral, political and legal implications of practices that are core to the business model of that firm,” writes Yochai Benkler, a Harvard Law School professor, in a recent article for Nature. “So too do governments that delegate policy frameworks to industry-dominated panels.” Last year Thomas Metzinger, a German philosophy professor, was named as one of the select group of ethicists who had been appointed to the European Union’s {AI} expert group. Around half of the 52 members of the {HLEG} were industry representatives. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple were represented by an organisation called {DigitalEurope}, which has since denied that the group was tilted in the industry’s favour. Metzinger and a machine learning expert were tasked with drawing up the “red lines” for the use of {AI} in Europe. “We did this for six months,” he says. “We talked to many other experts and extracted their proposals, formulated it and put it in a document of non-negotiable normative principles.” Two of the “red lines” Metzinger proposed were that {AI} should never be used to build either autonomous lethal weapons or social credit score systems akin to China’s. But after he submitted his proposals, some members of the group pushed for a softer stance. “Suddenly there was this categorical sentiment by various industry representatives and others that this phrase ‘red line’ cannot appear in that document anymore,” he recalls. The final version of the text, which has now been shared with the European Commission, instead referred to these issues as “critical concerns”. The Commission aspires for Europe to invest €20bn a year on {AI} in the coming years, and some experts have proposed the creation of a new dedicated centre of research similar to {CERN}. One way, says Metzinger, to ensure regulation keeps pace with the technology would be to establish an allied Ethics Centre of Excellence with a series of rotating fellowships, as well as a wider European network of 720 professorships in the applied ethics of {AI}. “For the Centre, the idea would be to have the young ethicists right there [working with the developers] and for the network to educate new generations of students and to keep the wider public informed and to structure public debates,” says Metzinger. “Europe is the last grown-up in the room between China and [President] Trump. We have to guide the debate.”},

Recent research has pointed to potential problems as a consequence of mobile overuse, including addiction, financial problems, dangerous use (i.e. whilst driving) and prohibited use (i.e. use in forbidden areas). The aim of this study is to extend previous findings regarding the predictive power of psychopathological symptoms (depression, anxiety and stress), mobile phone use (i.e. calls, {SMS}, time spent on the phone, as well as the engagement in specific smartphone activities) across Generations X and Y on problematic mobile phone use in a sample of 273 adults. Findings revealed prohibited use and dependence were predicted by calls/day, time on the phone and using social media. Only for dependent mobile phone use (rather than prohibited), stress appeared as significant. Using social media and anxiety significantly predicted belonging to Generation Y, with calls per day predicted belonging to Generation X. This finding suggests Generation Y are more likely to use asynchronous social media-based communication, whereas Generation X engage more in synchronous communication. The findings have implications for prevention and awareness-raising efforts of possibly problematic mobile phone use for educators, parents and individuals, particularly including dependence and prohibited use.},

Three hundred and sixty-five undergraduate university freshmen at Ramon Llull University, Barcelona (Spain), majoring in four different studies (Psychology, Education, Journalism and Broadcasting, and Health Studies) replied to scales assessing the negative consequences of maladaptive use of both the Internet ({CERI}) and the mobile phone ({CERM}), a self-report scale on Perceived Emotional Intelligence ({TMMS}-24), and a clinical instrument to check for complaints related to the presence of psychological distress (Symptom Checklist-90-R; {SCL}-90-R). Results indicate that psychological distress is related to maladaptive use of both the Internet and the mobile phone; females scored higher than males on the mobile phone questionnaire, showing more negative consequences of its maladaptive use. With respect to major study, students of Journalism and Broadcasting showed a more maladaptive pattern of Internet use than students of other majors. The components of Perceived Emotional Intelligence contributed to the explanation of the variance of the general indicators of psychological distress, but to a lesser degree than maladaptive use of Internet and mobile phone.},

	abstract = {Depression is disabling and treatable, but underdiagnosed. In this study, we show that the content shared by consenting users on Facebook can predict a future occurrence of depression in their medical records. Language predictive of depression includes references to typical symptoms, including sadness, loneliness, hostility, rumination, and increased self-reference. This study suggests that an analysis of social media data could be used to screen consenting individuals for depression. Further, social media content may point clinicians to specific symptoms of depression.Depression, the most prevalent mental illness, is underdiagnosed and undertreated, highlighting the need to extend the scope of current screening methods. Here, we use language from Facebook posts of consenting individuals to predict depression recorded in electronic medical records. We accessed the history of Facebook statuses posted by 683 patients visiting a large urban academic emergency department, 114 of whom had a diagnosis of depression in their medical records. Using only the language preceding their first documentation of a diagnosis of depression, we could identify depressed patients with fair accuracy [area under the curve ({AUC}) = 0.69], approximately matching the accuracy of screening surveys benchmarked against medical records. Restricting Facebook data to only the 6 months immediately preceding the first documented diagnosis of depression yielded a higher prediction accuracy ({AUC} = 0.72) for those users who had sufficient Facebook data. Significant prediction of future depression status was possible as far as 3 months before its first documentation. We found that language predictors of depression include emotional (sadness), interpersonal (loneliness, hostility), and cognitive (preoccupation with the self, rumination) processes. Unobtrusive depression assessment through social media of consenting individuals may become feasible as a scalable complement to existing screening and monitoring procedures.},

This study focuses on the psychological and practical consequences of Facebook use following job loss. By pairing longitudinal surveys of Facebook users with logs of their online behavior, we examine how communication with different kinds of ties predicts improvements in stress, social support, bridging social capital, and whether they find new jobs. Losing a job is associated with increases in stress, while talking with strong ties is generally associated with improvements in stress and social support. Weak ties do not provide these benefits. Bridging social capital comes from both strong and weak ties. Surprisingly, individuals who have lost a job feel greater stress after talking with strong ties. Contrary to the "strength of weak ties" hypothesis, communication with strong ties is more predictive of finding employment within three months.},

	abstract = {Our reputation is important to us; we’ve experienced natural selection to care about our reputation. Recently, the neural processing of gains in reputation (positive social feedback concerning one’s character) has been shown to occur in the human ventral striatum. It is still unclear, however, how individual differences in the processing of gains in reputation may lead to individual differences in real-world behavior. For example, in the real-world, one way that people currently maintain their reputation is by using social media websites, like Facebook. Furthermore, Facebook use consists of a social comparison component, where users observe others’ behavior and can compare it to their own. Therefore, we hypothesized a relationship between the way the brain processes specifically self-relevant gains in reputation and one’s degree of Facebook use. We recorded functional neuroimaging data while participants received gains in reputation, observed the gains in reputation of another person, or received monetary reward. We demonstrate that across participants, when responding to gains in reputation for the self, relative to observing gains for others, reward-related activity in the left nucleus accumbens predicts Facebook use. However, nucleus accumbens activity in response to monetary reward did not predict Facebook use. Finally, a control step-wise regression analysis showed that Facebook use primarily explains our results in the nucleus accumbens. Overall, our results demonstrate how individual sensitivity of the nucleus accumbens to the receipt of self-relevant social information leads to differences in real-world behavior.},

Among 14- to 17-year-olds, high users of screens (7+ h/day vs. low users of 1 h/day) were more than twice as likely to ever have been diagnosed with depression ({RR} 2.39, 95\% {CI} 1.54, 3.70), ever diagnosed with anxiety ({RR} 2.26, {CI} 1.59, 3.22), treated by a mental health professional ({RR} 2.22, {CI} 1.62, 3.03) or have taken medication for a psychological or behavioral issue ({RR} 2.99, {CI} 1.94, 4.62) in the last 12 months.

Methods: We reviewed quantitative and qualitative studies on smartphone addiction and analyzed their methods and conclusions to make a determination on the suitability of the diagnosis “addiction” to excessive and problematic smartphone use. Results: Although the majority of research in the ﬁeld declares that smartphones are addictive or takes the existence of smartphone addiction as granted, we did not ﬁnd sufﬁcient support from the addiction perspective to conﬁrm the existence of smartphone addiction at this time. The behaviors observed in the research could be better labeled as problematic or maladaptive smartphone use and their consequences do not meet the severity levels of those caused by addiction. Discussion and conclusions: Addiction is a disorder with severe effects on physical and psychological health. A behavior may have a similar presentation as addiction in terms of excessive use, impulse control problems, and negative consequences, but that does not mean that it should be considered an addiction. We propose moving away from the addiction framework when studying technological behaviors and using other terms such as “problematic use” to describe them. We recommend that problematic technology use is to be studied in its sociocultural context with an increased focus on its compensatory functions, motivations, and gratiﬁcations.},

	abstract = {Background
Smartphones are technological devices that have a great impact on people's daily lives changing their habits and behaviors. The utilities and capabilities of these devices are increasing and the foresight is that this tendency will grow in the next years. However, the problematic use of the smartphone has increased dangerously, interfering with the clinical practice of healthcare professionals.
Objective
To conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of smartphone addiction, also known as nomophobia, in nursing students and to identify its related factors and its negative effects.
Design
Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
Data sources
The literature search was done in {CINAHL}, Proquest, Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases.
Review methods
The search equation was “(nomophobia {OR} smartphone) {AND} nurs* student*”. n = 16 articles were identified.
Results
The meta-analytic estimation of nomophobia or smartphone addiction was 22\% ({CI}95\% 18\%–26\%] in a sample of n = 2780 nursing students. Smartphone usability is very extended during the clinical practice by nursing students. They indicated using the device or watching other students distracted with their smartphone. Some variables related to excessive use in nursing students are lower sleep quality, lower self-esteem, higher social distress, lower perceived social support or lower communication skills between others.
Conclusions
The main use of the smartphone by nursing students is for communication with other people and some of them indicate that it can be a distraction.},

Pairing a survey of 20,000 Facebook users measuring perceptions of problematic use with behavioral and demographic data, we examined Facebook activities associated with problematic use as well as the kinds of people most likely to experience it. People who feel their use is problematic are more likely to be younger, male, and going through a major life event such as a breakup. They spend more time on the platform, particularly at night, and spend proportionally more time looking at profiles and less time browsing their News Feeds. They also message their friends more frequently. While they are more likely to respond to notifications, they are also more likely to deactivate their accounts, perhaps in an effort to better manage their time. Further, they are more likely to have seen content about social media or phone addiction. Notably, people reporting problematic use rate the site as more valuable to them, highlighting the complex relationship between technology use and well-being. A better understanding of problematic Facebook use can inform the design of context-appropriate and supportive tools to help people become more in control.},

Design Cross-sectional survey study targeting undergraduate students. Associations between disordered online social networking use, internet addiction, deficits in emotion regulation and alcohol use problems were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses of covariance. Setting A large University in the Northeastern United States. Participants Undergraduate students (n = 253, 62.8\% female, 60.9\% white, age mean= 19.68, standard deviation = 2.85), largely representative of the target population. The response rate was 100\%. Measurements Disordered online social networking use, determined via modified measures of alcohol abuse and dependence, including {DSM}-{IV}-{TR} diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale and the Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-opener ({CAGE}) screen, along with the Young Internet Addiction Test, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-{II}, White Bear Suppression Inventory and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Findings Disordered online social networking use was present in 9.7\% [n = 23; 95\% confidence interval (5.9, 13.4)] of the sample surveyed, and significantly and positively associated with scores on the Young Internet Addiction Test (P {\textless} 0.001), greater difficulties with emotion regulation (P = 0.003) and problem drinking (P = 0.03). Conclusions The use of online social networking sites is potentially addictive. Modified measures of substance abuse and dependence are suitable in assessing disordered online social networking use. Disordered online social networking use seems to arise as part of a cluster of symptoms of poor emotion regulation skills and heightened susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addiction.},

However, in the years following the release of {DSM}-5, an expanding body of research has increasingly classified engagement in a wide range of common behaviours and leisure activities as possible behavioural addiction. If this expansion does not end, both the relevance and the credibility of the field of addictive disorders might be questioned, which may prompt a dismissive appraisal of the new {DSM}-5 subcategory for behavioural addiction. We propose an operational definition of behavioural addiction together with a number of exclusion criteria, to avoid pathologizing common behaviours and provide a common ground for further research. The definition and its exclusion criteria are clarified and justified by illustrating how these address a number of theoretical and methodological shortcomings that result from existing conceptualizations. We invite other researchers to extend our definition under an Open Science Foundation framework.},

In this review, we have recruited articles mentioning coexisting psychiatric disorders of Internet addiction from the {PubMed} database as at November 3, 2009. We describe the updated results for such disorders of Internet addiction, which include substance use disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, hostility, and social anxiety disorder. We also provide discussion for possible mechanisms accounting for the coexistence of psychiatric disorders and Internet addiction. The review might suggest that combined psychiatric disorders mentioned above should be evaluated and treated to prevent their deteriorating effect on the prognosis of Internet addiction. On the other hand, Internet addiction should be paid more attention to when treating people with these coexisting psychiatric disorders of Internet addiction. Additionally, we also suggest future necessary research directions that could provide further important information for the understanding of this issue. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson {SAS}.

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a self-diagnostic scale that could distinguish smartphone addicts based on the Korean self-diagnostic program for Internet addiction (K-scale) and the smartphone's own features. In addition, the reliability and validity of the smartphone addiction scale ({SAS}) was demonstrated. Methods: A total of 197 participants were selected from Nov. 2011 to Jan. 2012 to accomplish a set of questionnaires, including {SAS}, K-scale, modified Kimberly Young Internet addiction test (Y-scale), visual analogue scale ({VAS}), and substance dependence and abuse diagnosis of {DSM}-{IV}. There were 64 males and 133 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years (M = 26.06; {SD} = 5.96). Factor analysis, internal-consistency test, t-test, {ANOVA}, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of {SAS}. Results: Based on the factor analysis results, the subscale "disturbance of reality testing" was removed, and six factors were left. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of {SAS} were verified (Cronbach's alpha = 0.967). {SAS} and its subscales were significantly correlated with K-scale and Y-scale. The {VAS} of each factor also showed a significant correlation with each subscale. In addition, differences were found in the job (p {\textless} 0.05), education (p {\textless} 0.05), and self-reported smartphone addiction scores (p {\textless} 0.001) in {SAS}. Conclusions: This study developed the first scale of the smartphone addiction aspect of the diagnostic manual. This scale was proven to be relatively reliable and valid.},

We conducted an online survey among 386 respondents. The results revealed that habitual smartphone use is an important contributor to addictive smartphone behavior. Process related smartphone use is a strong determinant for both developing habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. People who extensively use their smartphones for social purposes develop smartphone habits faster, which in turn might lead to addictive smartphone behavior. We did not find an influence of emotional intelligence on habitual or addictive smartphone behavior, while social stress positively influences addictive smartphone behavior, and a failure of self-regulation seems to cause a higher risk of addictive smartphone behavior. Finally, men experience less social stress than women, and use their smartphones less for social purposes. The result is that women have a higher chance in developing habitual or addictive smartphone behavior. Age negatively affects process and social usage, and social stress. There is a positive effect on self-regulation. Older people are therefore less likely to develop habitual or addictive smartphone behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, relationships with existing categories of psychopathology are not well defined. We discuss the concept of problematic smartphone use, including possible causal pathways to such use. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the relationship between problematic use with psychopathology. Using scholarly bibliographic databases, we screened 117 total citations, resulting in 23 peer-reviewer papers examining statistical relations between standardized measures of problematic smartphone use/use severity and the severity of psychopathology. Results: Most papers examined problematic use in relation to depression, anxiety, chronic stress and/or low self-esteem. Across this literature, without statistically adjusting for other relevant variables, depression severity was consistently related to problematic smartphone use, demonstrating at least medium effect sizes. Anxiety was also consistently related to problem use, but with small effect sizes. Stress was somewhat consistently related, with small to medium effects. Self-esteem was inconsistently related, with small to medium effects when found. Statistically adjusting for other relevant variables yielded similar but somewhat smaller effects. Limitations: We only included correlational studies in our systematic review, but address the few relevant experimental studies also. Conclusions: We discuss causal explanations for relationships between problem smartphone use and psychopathology.},

The seriousness of this threat is increasingly recognized. Scientists willing to distort scientific research to serve vested interests receive millions of dollars for their services. Organizations such as the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, the World Association of Medical Editors and the Committee on Publication Ethics ({COPE}) have launched initiatives to establish international standards for Conflict of Interest ({COI}) disclosure. {COPE} requires its 7,000 member journals to comply with its Code of Conduct for Journal Editors. While these initiatives are encouraging, they are internal educational endeavours only. Five examples are given showing failure of {COPE} member journals to comply with {COPE}’s Code of Conduct. While {COPE} offers a complaint process, it involves only discussion and voluntary compliance. {COPE} neither polices nor enforces its Code. Instead of the current feeble, un-resourced process, which delivers neither transparency nor accountability, the article proposes the creation of a mechanism that will employ specific, effective measures to address contraventions of {COI} disclosure requirements.},

	abstract = {Disclosure—informing advice recipients of the potential bias of an advisor—is a popular tool to manage conﬂicts of interest. However, conﬂict of interest disclosures usually compete with a host of other information that is important, relevant or interesting to the advisee. Across one ﬁeld study and ﬁve experiments, we examine the eﬀect of conﬂict of interest disclosures in a realistic and context-rich setting (online blogs) in which the disclosure is short, clear and conspicuous (as desired by many regulatory bodies) but embedded in the context of other competing information. Our ﬁndings show that, in contrast to much of the prior research on conﬂict of interest disclosures, recipients who read a blog post containing a conﬂict of interest disclosure report increased trust in the blogger and evaluate the blogger, the blogger’s recommendation, and the sponsoring organization more favorably than recipients who read a post with no disclosure. The eﬀect is driven by disclosure acting as a heuristic cue to infer greater trust in the blogger’s expertise and consequently greater persuasion. The inference of greater expertise and its eﬀect on persuasion are mitigated when recipients deliberate on the disclosure. We discuss implications of these ﬁndings for organizations, advisors, consumers and policy makers.},

	url = {https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/responding-campaign-accountability-report-academic-research/},
	abstract = {Today the Campaign for Accountability released a report about our funding of academic research. It claims to list hundreds of papers we’ve “in some way funded.” The report is highly misleading. For example, the report attributes to Google any work that was supported by any organization to which we belong or have ever donated (such as {CCIA}).Nevertheless, we’re proud to maintain strong relations with academics, universities and research institutes, in our own name, so we wanted to take a few moments to respond to the report.We run many research programs that provide funding and resources to the external research community. This helps public and private institutions pursue research on important topics in computer science, technology, and a wide range of public policy and legal issues. Our support for the principles underlying an open internet is shared by many academics and institutions who have a long history of undertaking research on these topics—across important areas like copyright, patents, and free expression. We provide support to help them undertake further research, and to raise awareness of their ideas.These programs (and those run by other companies) augment the government and university-funded research that is the backbone of academic discourse in the United States.We also run policy fellowship programs. Most other companies do this too; the difference with Google is that we list ours publicly on our policy website.Our funding is guided by these principles:Disclosure requirements: When we provide financial support, we expect and require grantees to properly disclose our funding. If there are ever omissions or unclear disclosures, we work to tighten our requirements.Independence: We value academic independence and integrity. We offer grants for discrete pieces of research, not to shape academics’ subsequent scholarship. The researchers and institutions to whom we award research grants will often publish research with which we disagree. In fact, many of the academics listed by the Campaign for Accountability have criticized Google and our policy positions heavily on a variety of topics. Here are just three of the academics on their list, opposing and arguing against us on antitrust, net neutrality and privacy.The irony of discussing disclosures and transparency with the “Campaign for Accountability” is that this group consistently refuses to name its corporate funders. And those backers won’t ‘fess up either. The one funder the world does know about is Oracle, which is running a well-documented lobbying campaign against us. In its own name and through proxies, Oracle has funded many hundreds of articles, research papers, symposia and reports. Oracle is not alone—you can easily find similar activity by companies and organizations funded by our competitors, like {AT}\&amp;T, the {MPAA}, {ICOMP}, {FairSearch} and dozens more; including hundreds of pieces directly targeting Google. We’re proud of our programs and their integrity. The “Campaign for Accountability” and its funders are, clearly, not proud of theirs.},
