%\section{Further Remarks}
%\label{app:additional_paper}
%For reasons of concision and space I did not include all relevant and influential (i.e. highly cited) studies I found into section \ref{sec:mapping}, but present some sound bites from their papers:

%\citep{mcdaniel_new_2012} A study on well-being of new mothers found: \textquote{In sum, blogging may improve new mothersâ€™ well-being, as they feel more connected to the world outside their home through the Internet.}



%\citep{kross_facebook_2013} \textquote{On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection. Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.}

%\citep{rosen_is_2013} This study on Facebook use and clinical symptoms of psychiatric disorders finds: \textquote{The results showed both positive and negative aspects of technology including social media as well as apparently detrimental effects of a preference for multitasking.}



%\citep{orben_association_2019} A study on well-being and digital technology use finding: \textquote{Taking the broader context of the data into account suggests that these effects are too small to warrant policy change.}

%\citep{coyne_does_2020}: A Longitudinal study over 8 years with participants filling in a yearly survey: \textquote{Results revealed that increased time spent on social media was not associated with increased mental health issues across development when examined at the individual level.}
